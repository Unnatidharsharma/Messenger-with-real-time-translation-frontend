# Deployment Guide for Frontend (React App)

This guide explains how to deploy the frontend React application located in this directory.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Internet connection to install dependencies.

## 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Run Development Server (Optional)

To run the app locally in development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 3. Build Production Bundle

To create an optimized production build of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` folder containing static files for deployment.

## 4. Deploying the Production Build

You can deploy the contents of the `build` folder to any static hosting service. Some popular options:

- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `build` folder in the Netlify dashboard or connect your GitHub repo for continuous deployment.
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo and deploy directly.
- **GitHub Pages**: Use the `gh-pages` package to deploy the `build` folder.
- **Firebase Hosting**: Use Firebase CLI to deploy the static files.
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Host the static files on S3 and serve via CloudFront CDN.
- **Any static web server**: Serve the `build` folder using Nginx, Apache, or similar.

### Example: Deploying with `serve` package locally

You can serve the production build locally for testing using the `serve` package:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

This will serve the app at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Notes

- Make sure your backend API endpoints are correctly configured in the frontend before deployment.
- For routing to work correctly on static hosts, configure redirects to `index.html` as needed.
